    "question": "What are the five daily obligatory prayers in Islam?",
    "answer": "**The five daily obligatory prayers are:**\n\n- **Fajr (2 rak'ahs):** Performed at dawn.\n- **Dhuhr (4 rak'ahs):** Performed after the sun passes the zenith.\n- **Asr (4 rak'ahs):** Performed in the afternoon.\n- **Maghrib (3 rak'ahs):** Performed just after sunset.\n- **Isha (4 rak'ahs):** Performed after twilight disappears.\n\nThese five prayers form the core of daily Islamic worship and are mandatory for every adult Muslim. Performing them punctually is among the greatest acts of obedience and spiritual discipline.",

    "question": "Is it obligatory to face the qibla during prayer?",
    "answer": "Facing the **qibla (toward the Kaaba in Mecca)** is a mandatory condition for the validity of prayer. One must make a reasonable effort to determine the correct direction through observation, tools, or reliable information.\n\nIf a person is genuinely unable to determine the qibla despite trying, they may pray in the direction they reasonably believe is correct. If afterward they discover they faced incorrectly, the prayer is still valid provided they exerted due effort.",

    "question": "What actions invalidate the prayer?",
    "answer": "Prayer becomes invalid through actions that contradict the nature of worship, including **intentional speech**, **turning away from the qibla**, **losing the required purity**, or performing **excessive bodily movements** not part of prayer. Intentional laughter also breaks the prayer.\n\nMinor, involuntary motions do not harm the prayer, but anything considered disruptive or resembling normal daily activity invalidates it. Preserving stillness and humility is essential to maintaining validity.",

    "question": "When do the times for Dhuhr and Asr begin and end?",
    "answer": "**Dhuhr begins** once the sun passes the zenith (midday). After completing Dhuhr, the time for **Asr begins** and continues until sunset. A person must pray both Dhuhr and Asr before the sun sets.\n\nIf time is short and only one prayer can be performed before sunset, Dhuhr takes precedence since its time technically starts earlier. However, both should be prayed even when late, but as qadha.",

    "answer": "A traveler who meets the conditions for qasr must reduce **Dhuhr**, **Asr**, and **Isha** to two rak'ahs each. **Fajr and Maghrib remain unchanged.**\n\nTravel prayers apply when the journey is long enough (approx. 44 km one way), the person intends to travel that distance from the beginning, and they do not intend to stay at the destination for ten days. These rules encourage ease and flexibility for the traveler.",

    "answer": "Congregational prayer is among the most emphasized recommended acts in Islam. For men, performing daily prayers in jama'ah carries immense spiritual reward and strengthens communal bonds.\n\nAlthough not obligatory for daily prayers according to Sistani, it is highly encouraged and especially emphasized for Fajr, Maghrib, and Isha. Joining a jama'ah should be prioritized whenever possible unless a legitimate excuse prevents participation.",

    "answer": "If a person doubts between **three and four rak'ahs** in a four-rakah prayer, they must assume the higher number (four) and complete the prayer. Afterward, they perform a **precautionary prayer** of one or two standing rak'ahs depending on the type of doubt.\n\nThese rules ensure the prayer maintains its structure even when uncertainty arises, while the precautionary prayer compensates for any potential deficiency.",

    "answer": "Prayer requires purity of the body and clothing. Najasah invalidates the prayer unless it belongs to categories considered excused, such as **blood less than the size of a coin** or unavoidable impurities.\n\nIf the impurity is discovered during prayer and removal is possible without breaking posture, one must remove or purify it immediately. If removal is not possible, the prayer should be repeated afterward.",

    "answer": "Missed obligatory prayers must be performed as **qadha**, but they do not need to be made up immediately unless the person fears forgetting. However, delaying them without reasonable cause is spiritually detrimental.\n\nConsistency is encouraged—performing qadha gradually while maintaining regular daily prayers helps restore spiritual discipline and accountability.",

In such cases, the person prays in whatever direction and posture is possible.\n\nWhen facing the qibla is possible, it must be maintained at least during takbiratul ihram. One should minimize unnecessary movement and maintain reverence.",
