    "question": "What are the five daily obligatory prayers in Islam?",
    "answer": "**The five daily obligatory prayers are:**\n\n- **Fajr (2 rak'ahs):** Performed at dawn.\n- **Dhuhr (4 rak'ahs):** Performed after the sun passes the zenith.\n- **Asr (4 rak'ahs):** Performed in the afternoon.\n- **Maghrib (3 rak'ahs):** Performed just after sunset.\n- **Isha (4 rak'ahs):** Performed after twilight disappears.\n\nThese five prayers form the core of daily Islamic worship and are mandatory for every adult Muslim. Performing them punctually is among the greatest acts of obedience and spiritual discipline.",

    "question": "Is it obligatory to face the qibla during prayer?",
    "answer": "Facing the **qibla (toward the Kaaba in Mecca)** is a mandatory condition for the validity of prayer. One must make a reasonable effort to determine the correct direction through observation, tools, or reliable information.\n\nIf a person is genuinely unable to determine the qibla despite trying, they may pray in the direction they reasonably believe is correct. If afterward they discover they faced incorrectly, the prayer is still valid provided they exerted due effort.",

    "answer": "Prayer becomes invalid through actions that contradict the nature of worship, including **intentional speech**, **turning away from the qibla**, **losing the required purity**, or performing **excessive bodily movements** not part of prayer. Intentional laughter also breaks the prayer.\n\nMinor, involuntary motions do not harm the prayer, but anything considered disruptive or resembling normal daily activity invalidates it. Preserving stillness and humility is essential to maintaining validity.",

    "answer": "**Dhuhr begins** once the sun passes the zenith (midday). After completing Dhuhr, the time for **Asr begins** and continues until sunset. A person must pray both Dhuhr and Asr before the sun sets.\n\nIf time is short and only one prayer can be performed before sunset, Dhuhr takes precedence since its time technically starts earlier. However, both should be prayed even when late, but as qadha.",

    "answer": "A traveler who meets the conditions for qasr must reduce **Dhuhr**, **Asr**, and **Isha** to two rak'ahs each. **Fajr and Maghrib remain unchanged.**\n\nTravel prayers apply when the journey is long enough (approx. 44 km one way), the person intends to travel that distance from the beginning, and they do not intend to stay at the destination for ten days. These rules encourage ease and flexibility for the traveler.",

Afterward, they perform a **precautionary prayer** of one or two standing rak'ahs depending on the type of doubt.\n\nThese rules ensure the prayer maintains its structure even when uncertainty arises, while the precautionary prayer compensates for any potential deficiency.",
