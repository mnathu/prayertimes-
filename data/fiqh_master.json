    "question": "What are the five daily obligatory prayers in Islam?",
    "answer": "**The five daily obligatory prayers are:**\n\n- **Fajr (2 rak'ahs):** Performed at dawn.\n- **Dhuhr (4 rak'ahs):** Performed after the sun passes the zenith.\n- **Asr (4 rak'ahs):** Performed in the afternoon.\n- **Maghrib (3 rak'ahs):** Performed just after sunset.\n- **Isha (4 rak'ahs):** Performed after twilight disappears.\n\nThese five prayers form the core of daily Islamic worship and are mandatory for every adult Muslim. Performing them punctually is among the greatest acts of obedience and spiritual discipline.",

    "question": "Is it obligatory to face the qibla during prayer?",
    "answer": "Facing the **qibla (toward the Kaaba in Mecca)** is a mandatory condition for the validity of prayer. One must make a reasonable effort to determine the correct direction through observation, tools, or reliable information.\n\nIf a person is genuinely unable to determine the qibla despite trying, they may pray in the direction they reasonably believe is correct. If afterward they discover they faced incorrectly, the prayer is still valid provided they exerted due effort.",

    "answer": "Prayer becomes invalid through actions that contradict the nature of worship, including **intentional speech**, **turning away from the qibla**, **losing the required purity**, or performing **excessive bodily movements** not part of prayer. Intentional laughter also breaks the prayer.\n\nMinor, involuntary motions do not harm the prayer, but anything considered disruptive or resembling normal daily activity invalidates it. Preserving stillness and humility is essential to maintaining validity.",

A person must pray both Dhuhr and Asr before the sun sets.\n\nIf time is short and only one prayer can be performed before sunset, Dhuhr takes precedence since its time technically starts earlier.

The guiding principle is that doubts about actions already passed are often ignored, while doubts about essential pillars may require correction.\n\nFor example, if someone doubts whether they recited Surah al-Fatiha after they have already started the next surah, the doubt is ignored.

    "details_markdown": "If someone joins a jama‘ah after it has started, they simply join the imam wherever he is. For example, if the imam is in rukū‘ of the second rak‘ah, the follower joins by entering rukū‘ immediately.\n\nWhen the imam finishes the prayer, the late joiner stands and completes the number of rak‘āt they missed. These additional rak‘āt are prayed individually but are treated as the follower's first rak‘āt for recitation purposes.\n\nAccording to Sayyid Sistani, joining before the imam rises from rukū‘ counts as catching that rak‘ah.",

    "details_markdown": "If any condition of jama‘ah is violated—such as losing connection to the row, not hearing or seeing the imam sufficiently, or discovering the imam is not just (‘adil)—the follower’s jama‘ah becomes invalid.\n\nIn such a case, the follower must immediately switch the intention to **individual prayer** and continue without interruption. The prayer remains valid as an individual salah.\n\nHowever, deliberately invalidating jama‘ah without reason is disliked.",

However, if order is forgotten or unclear, one may perform them in any sequence.\n\nIt is recommended to complete qadha prayers quickly and not delay them unnecessarily.",
